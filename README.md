Issabel is an open source distribution and GUI for Unified Communications systems forked from Elastix&copy;

It uses the [Asterisk©](http://www.asterisk.org/ "Asterisk Home Page") open source PBX software as its core.

Outbound SMTP relay configuration for Issabel.

Issabel 6 does not ship a mail server: there are no local mailboxes and no
inbound SMTP. This module keeps only the **SMTP Relay** page, which configures a
send-only Postfix (satellite) that forwards all locally generated mail
(Asterisk voicemail, `mail()`, PHPMailer, `CI_Email`, cron, fail2ban) to an
external smarthost with SASL/TLS.
